# Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for assessments throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Assessments are designed to evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

## Assessment Structure

### Weekly Assessments
- **Format**: Hands-on exercises and implementation challenges
- **Frequency**: Weekly assignments aligned with module content
- **Duration**: 3-6 hours per week (varies by complexity)
- **Weight**: 25% of total course grade

### Module Projects
- **Format**: Comprehensive implementation projects
- **Frequency**: One per module (4 total)
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks per project
- **Weight**: 40% of total course grade

### Mid-term Practical
- **Format**: Comprehensive simulation and implementation exam
- **Duration**: 4-hour practical examination
- **Weight**: 15% of total course grade

### Capstone Project
- **Format**: Autonomous humanoid system integration
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks development + presentation
- **Weight**: 20% of total course grade

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Implementation (40%)
- Correctness of code implementation
- Proper use of ROS 2 patterns and best practices
- Integration of multiple systems and components
- Performance and efficiency considerations

### Code Quality (25%)
- Code readability and documentation
- Adherence to PEP 8 Python standards
- Proper error handling and validation
- Modular and reusable code design

### Problem-Solving Approach (20%)
- Logical approach to problem decomposition
- Appropriate selection of algorithms and techniques
- Creative solutions to implementation challenges
- Effective debugging and troubleshooting

### Documentation and Communication (15%)
- Clear explanation of implementation decisions
- Proper use of comments and documentation
- Professional presentation of results
- Effective communication of technical concepts

## Assessment Schedule

- **Week 5**: URDF and robot control project

### Module 2: Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7)
- **Week 6**: Gazebo simulation environments
- **Week 7**: Unity-ROS integration project

### Module 3: AI Brain (Weeks 8-10)
- **Week 8**: VSLAM implementation
- **Week 9**: Navigation system development
- **Week 10**: AI decision-making project

### Module 4: VLA (Weeks 11-13)
- **Week 11**: Voice command integration
- **Week 12**: LLM-based planning
- **Week 13**: Capstone project and presentation

## Submission Requirements

### Code Submissions
- All code must be properly commented and documented
- Include README files with setup and execution instructions
- Use version control with meaningful commit messages
- Provide evidence of testing and validation

### Documentation
- Explain design decisions and implementation choices
- Include performance metrics and validation results
- Document any deviations from expected behavior
- Provide clear instructions for evaluation

### Deliverables Format
- GitHub repository with all source code
- Written reports for complex projects

## Grading Scale

- **A (90-100%)**: Exceptional work demonstrating deep understanding and creative solutions
- **B (80-89%)**: Good work meeting all requirements with minor issues
- **C (70-79%)**: Adequate work meeting basic requirements
- **D (60-69%)**: Below expectations with significant issues
- **F (Below 60%)**: Inadequate work not meeting requirements

## Late Submission Policy

- **1-2 days late**: 10% grade reduction
- **3-7 days late**: 25% grade reduction
- **More than 7 days late**: Not accepted without prior approval

## Collaboration Policy

- Individual assignments must be completed independently
- Group discussions encouraged for conceptual understanding
- Code sharing strictly prohibited
- Proper attribution required for any external resources used

## Resources and Support

### Office Hours
