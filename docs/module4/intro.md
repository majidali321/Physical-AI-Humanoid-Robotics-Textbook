# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Module 4 brings together all previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system. You'll learn to integrate voice command processing, Large Language Model (LLM) based planning, and create a capstone project that demonstrates all the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Process voice commands using OpenAI Whisper
- Integrate LLMs for cognitive planning and task decomposition
- Create complete autonomous humanoid systems
- Implement vision-language-action loops for intelligent behavior
- Build and present a comprehensive capstone project

## Module Structure

This module spans three weeks of the 13-week course:

- **Week 11**: Voice Command Systems - OpenAI Whisper integration and voice processing
- **Week 12**: LLM Integration - Cognitive planning and LLM-robot interaction
- **Week 13**: Capstone Project - Integration of all modules into autonomous humanoid

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3 (all previous fundamentals)
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with API integration patterns

## Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

- **OpenAI Whisper**: Voice command recognition and processing
- **Large Language Models**: Cognitive planning and task decomposition
- **ROS 2**: Integration layer for all system components
- **Python**: Voice and LLM integration
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: Advanced perception for VLA systems

Let's create the complete autonomous humanoid system!
