# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

Module 3 introduces the AI components that form the "brain" of intelligent humanoid robots. Using NVIDIA Isaac tools, you'll learn to implement perception systems, navigation algorithms, and AI decision-making capabilities that enable robots to understand their environment and make intelligent choices.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Implement Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Create navigation systems using Nav2 for bipedal movement
- Integrate AI perception and action systems
- Build cognitive architectures for robot decision-making

## Module Structure

This module spans three weeks of the 13-week course:

- **Week 8**: NVIDIA Isaac Introduction - Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and VSLAM concepts
- **Week 9**: Navigation Systems - Nav2 framework, path planning, and bipedal movement
- **Week 10**: AI Decision Making - AI integration, perception-action loops, and cognitive systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and simulation fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of computer vision concepts
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)

## Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Advanced simulation environment for AI robotics
- **NVIDIA Isaac ROS**: ROS 2 packages for perception and manipulation
- **Nav2**: Navigation stack for robot path planning and execution
- **Python**: AI integration and algorithm implementation
- **ROS 2**: Integration layer for AI components

Let's begin building the AI brain for your humanoid robot!
