# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Module 2 focuses on creating digital twins for humanoid robots using two powerful simulation environments: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for advanced environment building. This module bridges the gap between the foundational ROS 2 concepts learned in Module 1 and the advanced AI integration in subsequent modules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo
- Build complex environments in Unity for robot testing
- Integrate Unity with ROS 2 for seamless simulation-control loops
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Validate robot behaviors in both simulation environments

## Module Structure

This module spans two weeks of the 13-week course:

- **Week 6**: Gazebo Simulation - Physics simulation fundamentals, environment creation, and sensor simulation
- **Week 7**: Unity Digital Twin - Environment building, Unity-ROS integration, and complete digital twin implementation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (forces, motion, collisions)
- Familiarity with 3D coordinate systems and transformations

## Technology Stack

In this module, you'll work with:

- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation environment for realistic robot testing
- **Unity**: 3D environment building and advanced simulation
- **ROS 2**: Integration layer between simulation environments and control systems
- **Python**: Scripting and control interfaces

Let's begin exploring the world of digital twins for robotics!
