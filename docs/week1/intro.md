# Week 1: Physical AI Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and embodied intelligence concepts
- Understand the relationship between AI and robotics
- Identify key components of intelligent physical systems
- Set up the development environment for the course
- Begin exploring basic robotics concepts

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI involves intelligent systems that interact with and operate in the physical world.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
2. **Real-time Processing**: Systems that must respond to environmental changes in real-time
3. **Multi-modal Perception**: Integration of various sensors (vision, touch, sound, etc.) to understand the environment
4. **Action-Perception Loop**: Continuous cycle of sensing, reasoning, and acting in the physical world

### Historical Context

Physical AI builds upon decades of robotics and AI research. The field has evolved from simple programmed robots to complex systems capable of learning and adaptation in unstructured environments.

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This perspective suggests that the body and environment play crucial roles in cognitive processes.

### Principles of Embodied Intelligence

1. **Morphological Computation**: Physical properties of the body contribute to intelligent behavior
2. **Environment as a Sensor**: The environment provides information that reduces computational load
3. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors arise from simple local interactions

## Humanoid Robotics Focus

This course focuses on humanoid robotics, which presents unique challenges and opportunities:

### Advantages of Humanoid Design
- Natural interaction with human environments
- Potential for human-like manipulation tasks
- Biologically-inspired movement patterns

### Challenges

- High degrees of freedom requiring sophisticated control
- Safety considerations for human interaction

## Course Tools and Technologies

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Middleware for robotics applications
- Provides communication infrastructure between robot components
- Essential for modern robotics development

### Simulation Environments
- Gazebo: Physics-accurate simulation
- Unity: High-fidelity visual simulation
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: AI-focused robotics simulation

### AI Integration
